Script
-------------------------------------
run_analysis.R which does the following. 

  1 Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
  2  Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
  3  Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
  4  Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 

    From the data set in step 4, Script creates a second, independent tidy data set (My_tidy_data_set.txt) with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
